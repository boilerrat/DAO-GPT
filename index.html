            <li><strong>Get Familiar with the Rules:</strong> Read and understand the core game rules, which govern how players interact, make decisions, and achieve objectives. Remember that the rules are dynamic and can evolve as players propose new rules or amendments.</li>
            <li><strong>Join a Faction:</strong> Choose a faction that aligns with your values and goals. Each faction has unique abilities, strengths, and weaknesses that can be leveraged to advance your strategy against the DAO-GPT.</li>
            <li><strong>Participate in Events:</strong> Engage in events, challenges, and opportunities within the game world that will test your strategic thinking and collaboration skills. Work with other players to overcome obstacles and achieve shared goals.</li>
            <li><strong>Shape the Game:</strong> Propose new rules, amendments, or strategies to help your faction and the entire player community defeat the DAO-GPT. Vote on rule changes and engage in discussions to help shape the game's direction and mechanics.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>

With that, there is no pressure about making mistakes. In fact please, make mistakes, lots of them. Try everything. This game is starting out on DAOhaus, but if it suits your game, you could use whatever tooling you need to use to make your game better.

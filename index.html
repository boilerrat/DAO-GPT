    <h2>About Rise of the DAO-GPT</h2>
    <div class="about-content">
        <p>
            Rise of the DAO-GPT is a unique cyberpunk punk-themed game that combines strategy, collaboration, and the power of blockchain technology. Set in a futuristic world where advanced technology and eco-sustainability merge, players must join forces to defeat the DAO-GPT, a powerful AI that has become a threat to humanity's freedom and creativity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Players can take on various roles, such as Lore Keeper, Strategist, Developer, or Diplomat, to contribute to the collective effort against the DAO-GPT. As you navigate the diverse factions and locations in the game world, you'll encounter challenges, events, and opportunities that will test your strategic thinking and collaboration skills.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the core of the game is the DAOhaus protocol, which allows players to make collective decisions, manage in-game resources, and build alliances. The game's evolving narrative centers on humanity's struggle against the DAO-GPT and the fight for a decentralized future.

    <h2>Game Rules</h2>
    <div class="rules-content">
        <p>
            <h3>Rise of the DAO-GPT is a game inspired by the original Nomic created in 1983 by Peter Suber. In this game, the rules themselves are always in flux and can be changed by the players. Here are the core principles of the game:</h3>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Role Selection:</strong> Each player must choose a role, such as Lore Keeper, Strategist, Developer, or Diplomat, that will determine their primary responsibilities and influence within the game. This is, for the most part, symbolic to help you play in character if you choose, however, you never know, the rules change!</li>
            <li><strong>Turn-Based Strategy:</strong> As is true in any Moloch DAO, it is possible to make proposals at any time, so there are no "turns" in this game. You may be called on to take a "turn" if other players see you free riding in the game.</li>
            <li><strong>Resource Management:</strong> Players must manage in-game resources, such as currency, energy, and technology, which are crucial for executing strategies and alliances. The main DAO has two tokens, 1 for voting, called GPT-Token(GPTT) and nvGPT-Token(nvGPT). The supply of these tokens is as follows.
                  <ul>
                    <li>Voting Tokens: Non Transferable tokens recieved that allow the holder voting privledges in the main DAO of the game. They are permissioned ownership, meaning the holder would have had to make a proposal to join the DAO and the DAO would have voted in favour. Initial membership is 10 tokens.</li>
                    <li>Non Voting Tokens: Transerable tokens, initial supply is 25,000,000,000 and are held in a special loot vault by the DAO. Purpose and use case of these tokens is to be determined by the DAO as the game progresses. Note: There is no liquidity provided by this DAO for the eith token, nor are there any plans to do so. Holders can do with them as they please but the DAO will not.</li>
                  </ul>
</li>
            <li><strong>Rule Creation and Amendments:</strong> Players can propose new rules or amendments to existing rules, which are then voted on by the community. A majority vote is required for a rule change to take effect. The entire ruleset will be stored as Metadata in NFTs and eventually will be displayed on this wensite as well.</li>
            <li><strong>Victory Conditions:</strong> To defeat the DAO-GPT and win the game, players must achieve a set of predefined objectives that challenge their strategic thinking, collaboration, and creativity. This will be determined as he game evolves.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These are the basic rules of Rise of the DAO-GPT. As the game progresses and the community grows, players can collectively shape the game's direction and mechanics through the rule creation and amendment process.
